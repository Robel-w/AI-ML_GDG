1. Identify an ML Problem
Problem: A streaming app learns to recommend the best movie for each user by continuously adjusting to their real-time viewing behavior.

2. Classify the ML Type
Type: Reinforcement Learning  
Why: The system learns through repeated interactions. It shows a movie suggestion and sees whether the user watches or skips it. 
Then it updates its strategy to improve future recommendations. It enhances long-term user engagement through trial-and-feedback cycles. 

3. Outline the ML Workflow
The system watches how each user interacts with movie suggestions and learns from their choices. 
It recommends a movie (action), checks if the user watches or skips it (reward), and updates its strategy based on that feedback. 
Over time, it figures out what each user prefers by balancing trying new recommendations and repeating successful ones. This continuous loop helps the system get smarter with every interaction.

4. Failure Point + Fix
Failure Point: Bad Evaluation   
If the reward function is too simple, it might push content that doesn’t truly match user preferences.
How to Fix It:  
Refine the reward signal to reflect meaningful engagement, such as full-view completions, replays, or strong ratings.
